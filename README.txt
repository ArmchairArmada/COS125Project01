Description:
Project 1 for COS 125 at the University of Maine is a solo game development
project.  My goal is to try to create something reasonably interesting permitted
the workload of my assignments allow it.

A few other projects have been included to minimise the number of dependencies players would need to install to get the game up and running.  I only wanted Python and PyGame to be required.

Project inludes a copy of tmxlib:
